# David 
*DevOps & Security Engineer | Cloud, Linux, and Automation Enthusiast*  

## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m building a career at the intersection of **DevOps and Cybersecurity**. With a foundation in IT support and hands-on labs in **Linux, Cloud, Containerization, and Security Monitoring**, I focus on creating practical projects that demonstrate problem-solving, automation, and security-first thinking.  

Currently working on:  
- Linux administration and scripting  
- Docker & containerization  
- AWS cloud deployments (EC2, S3, IAM)  
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform  
- Security monitoring with SIEM (Azure Sentinel)  

I document everything I learn here, so this GitHub reflects both my **progress** and my **projects**.
